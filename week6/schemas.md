## What is a schema? 

* A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of an entire database.

* It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated.

* An easy way to envision a schema is to think of it as a box that holds tables, stored procedures, views, and related data assets.

## Why/When would you need one?

* Schemas are mainly used to manage several logical entities in one physical database.

* Schemas offer a convenient way to separate database users from database object owners.

* They provide the ability to protect sensitive objects in the database.

* And also to allow database objects to be organized into a logical group.
